About Mutinex
We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.

Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.

We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.

Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR & have seed funding ($5 million in May 2023 & $9.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.

Equity (ESOP) is offered to all staff on top of their salary and we also offer additional annual leave after 1 year of tenure (from 20 to 25 days a year) that continues to grow another day each year of service until you max out at 30 days per year.","Skills: Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Data analysis skills, Tableau, SQL",Redfern,--,--,--,Unknown / Non-Applicable,1 to 50 Employees,Company - Private

We are a customer-obsessed, boutique, data consultancy that designs, builds and transitions elegant, data-driven solutions that solve the most challenging business problems across a wide range of public and private sector organisations.
We are deliberately narrow in our focus areas, but we go deep in each of them, to the point where, if it starts with the word “data”, we probably do it.
We build on AWS, Snowflake, Databricks and a range of modern data platform technologies, using the latest tools, patterns, practices and reference architectures.
We have teams located in Melbourne and Sydney and continue to enjoy solid growth by consistently winning repeat projects with customers that treat us as a natural and trusted extension of their inhouse data, analytics, and ML teams.

Job Description

As a Principal Consultant, you will own the D2E program within The Data Foundry (TDF). This will entail becoming the key D2E contact with AWS, delivering our D2E “working backwards” workshops, shaping MVP projects, then scaling these as customers come to appreciate the power of the data “flywheel”.
You will provide our customers with an elite level of technical and consulting expertise, focused on building consultative data strategies that encompass sound data governance, data security and data privacy principles.
You will earn trust with our customers and fast become their “go to” contact for advice on all aspects of their data-related plans – from strategy through to program planning and execution.
You will work collaboratively with our existing TDF experts, supporting and enhancing our technical and delivery assurance capabilities, while working hand in glove with our CDAO, Data Scientists, Data Engineers, and Data Analysts. Together, you will gather, dissect, and prioritise the data-related requirements that feed into the design of solutions that solve real-world challenges for our customers.
Your prior experience using a modern, consultative approach to tackling similar, large-scale, business problems and your ability to translate these into secure, scalable, cloud-based, “art of the possible” solutions, will see you thriving in this role.
Do you possess?
Expertise in providing authoritative, consulting advice, technical guidance and expertise to clients and internal teams in the development and implementation of data strategies and related change programmes
The ability to deliver compelling, outcomes-based, customer-centric workshops
A strong background in data security, data governance, data privacy, and data-centric solution development
An instinct for zeroing in on data-related customer use cases that are likely to represent significant return on investment
Proven experience with DataOps principles and toolsets
A familiarity with Agile development methodologies and rituals
A knack for troubleshooting various technical problems across a wide-variety of technical and data platforms
The confidence to build effective customer relationships with the ability to translate business requirements into sound, technical specifications, effort estimates and Statements of Work
The ability to identify new market opportunities, analyse competitor activities, perform market research and re-purpose marketing assets to take advantage of those opportunities
Experience recommending new product opportunities and preparing business cases based on the market research and Intelligence gathered
Hands-on experience contributing to developing and improving business processes and supporting systems.

Qualifications

Requirements:
Masters Degree in Computer Science, Data Science, or related field
5 years of experience in data strategy, analytics, governance, security, or related fields

We’re passionate about the technical community we are a part of and believe in giving something back to the open source, AWS, Snowflake, Databricks and other communities that we draw so heavily from

We support and contribute to a different cause each quarter, based on employee nominations, where a modest donation can have a disproportionate impact on the outcomes they drive
We’re committed to developing your career by way of a customised, Growth and Development plan

Industry PhD Scholarship: Safety and Bias,Leonardo.Ai,null,['4.0'],"Safety and Bias in Generative AI
Description
The Data Science Institute (DSI) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is a world leader in data science and ethical artificial intelligence and has a strong focus on Industry engagement. The UTS Data Science Institute DSI boasts over 200 PhD students and 100 academic staff with award winning researchers in AI
In collaboration with Leonardo.Ai we are advertising an industry PhD program that will tackle research questions at the bleeding edge of GenAI research with an aim to drive forward both foundational research in the field through traditional publication outputs, as well as supercharging the Leonardo.Ai platform. Leonardo.Ai is a world leader in generative AI and is building one of the leading AI laboratories in foundational AI research. Leonardo.Ai has also recently been acquired by Canva and now hosts over 200 million users through the combined platforms. Both Leonardo.Ai and Canva have strong principles in: being a good human being foremost, maximizing impact, moving at speed and owning our goals and winning together.
Project Aims
This PhD project aims to advance the field of safe and ethical generative AI by developing robust classification and detection methods specifically for AI-generated media. Current safety classifiers are primarily trained on real-world images and video, which often fail to perform effectively on AI-generated content. Addressing this gap, the research will focus on designing and refining safety classification methods for multi-modal outputs in generative AI. The student will therefore push the current safety methodologies into the regime of precision machine learning, such that edge cases are exceptionally rare on large scale multi-modal AI.
Thesis topics will explore a variety of approaches, including classification systems for generated outputs, analysis of model hidden states, and other metrics for detecting undesirable content. The research may also involve post-training techniques to refine and remove problematic concepts from AI-generated outputs. We aim to open source this work and present the research findings at major AI conferences globally.
The successful PhD candidate will have access to leading edge compute facilities (e.g. H100s), a team of world class research leaders across both UTS, Leonardo and Canva, cutting edge tools to conduct research, and mentoring and guidance to complete a best-in-class PhD research program.
Eligibility
We are looking for the best of the best! You will be adequately qualified to enter the UTS PhD scheme with Undergraduate / Postgraduate Qualifications in e.g. Computer Science, Data Science, AI, Physics, Mathematics or equivalent.

Candidate Profile
A strong background in programming, mathematics, statistics or related areas.
Knowledge and interest in Diffusion, GANs, LLMs and generative AI in general as demonstrated by independent project work in GitHub.
Proficiency in modern deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch or Jax.
Ideally, we are looking for candidates with previous experience in top-tier Tech companies. We, however, welcome applications from underrepresented groups and diverse backgrounds.
Proficiency in English (both Verbal and Written).
Location
This PhD will be hosted at the University of Technology Sydney and the student will spend significant time at the Leonardo.Ai headquarters, which is located on the waterfront in North Sydney (20 mins train ride from UTS).

About the team
Deloitte Legal is a fast-growing Australian incorporated legal practice with offices in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Adelaide.

Today’s corporate General Counsel faces multiple challenges: a heightened regulatory environment, mass globalisation of business and acceleration of technology advancements. This is resulting in increased complexity and demand from the business, in turn creating an unsustainable workload for existing in-house legal and contracting teams. The current business landscape creates a compelling reason for legal departments to rethink their operating model, achieve greater efficiencies and increase the value they deliver back to the business.

Deloitte Legal’s Legal Management Consulting and Legal Managed Services practices help inhouse legal teams transform through optimising their operating model, leveraging the power of technology and AI, and augmenting capabilities through effective and efficient managed service offerings.

Deloitte Legal more broadly provides a growing portfolio of legal services as diverse as our clients, including corporate legal work, foreign investment advisory and applications, employment, digital, intellectual property, climate and trust law, transactional services, the preparation and review of legal documentation, Federal and State tax and stamp duty advisory and dispute resolution, corporate reorganisations and more.

As part of a global network, we have access to more than 2,500 legal practitioners who operate in more than 80 countries. We work closely with other businesses within Deloitte in Australia and globally to deliver holistic business solutions to our clients and to make an impact that matters!

If you’re looking for a team that’s driven, supportive and will invest in your career – Deloitte Legal is the place for you.

The opportunity

You will be based in Sydney and will have three (3) to five (5) years PQE or equivalent gained within a law firm, consultancy or in-house team, ideally driving legal operations and legal transformation initiatives.

You will be primarily responsible for:
project management and delivery of engagements, including designing and delivering client workshops, analysing and drawing insights from legal ops datasets and liaising with client and internal stakeholders
assisting clients to assess, select and implement market leading legal technology solutions
reviewing and designing target legal operating models and better ways of working
developing and delivering thought leadership and client labs on the latest thinking and trends across legal transformation, technology, AI and legal sourcing strategy
supporting the coordination and delivery of our various managed services offerings, and
contributing to business development and the continued growth and expansion of the practice.

What will your typical day look like?

You are someone with:
Bachelor's degree in law and admitted solicitor (preferred), data science and IT or related field, or equivalent combination of education and experience will be considered.
At least five years of experience in legal operations, legal transformation, project management or management consulting, preferably in a law firm or inhouse legal environment.
Demonstrated knowledge and expertise in legal technology and CLM solutions and platforms, including their configuration and implementation.
Excellent leadership, communication, collaboration and problem-solving skills.
Ability to manage multiple projects, priorities and stakeholders in a fast-paced and dynamic environment.
Ability to translate complex technical concepts and requirements into clear and concise business terms and outcomes.
Self-motivated and proactive, with the ability to work independently and take initiative.
Continuous learning and improvement mindset, with the ability to seek and apply feedback and new knowledge
Thrive in a fast-paced and collaborative team environment
Have strong time management and organisational skills and excellent verbal and written communication skills

Work Where It’s Best for You
Work Anywhere means you can work in an office or at home on any given day. It’s about getting the work done in the way and place that works best for each person. This applies across all locations and departments.
Work Anywhere does not mean work at any time. We have predictable core hours where employees are generally available for meetings and collaboration. Employees are focused and available during core hours.
We invest in our offices to make them places where our employees like to go. If you work in the office three or more days a week, you will have a dedicated office workspace. Our offices function as hubs to draw people in, create social bonds, and where random connections and mixing of ideas happen. We’re investing more in offices, culture, and offsite meetings, not less.
Product teams are organized in regional product hubs for optimal collaboration and live within a time zone of their hub. Our current product hubs are located in Pleasanton, Columbus, Boston, Kansas City, New York City, Raleigh, and Toronto. We create opportunities for teams to get together in person regularly.
Customer-facing roles, such as Sales and Professional Services, live near and/or travel to their customers.
When an employee moves within a country it does not cause a change in salary. Where you live impacts you and your family. Not knowing if your compensation will change if you move can cause stress and uncertainty for everyone. We wanted to eliminate that.

In 2010, Tony Jordan, Chef winemaker at Chandon Australia set off to learn about India’s emerging viticultural regions, from Bangalore in the south to Himachal Pradesh in the north. India has no long wine tradition, no terroirs with centuries of form. Its climate is tropical, with fierce summers and torrential monsoon rains.
Tony Jordan finally homed in on a terroir around Dindori, Nashik, 200km northeast of Mumbai. The first grapes – Chenin Blanc, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir – were bought in February 2011 and vinified in rented equipment and tanks at a local winery. Chandon India was officially launched with the release of the first cuvées in January 2014, and our winery was opened in April 2016.","Skills: Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Data analysis skills, Tableau, SQL",Melbourne,1974,Food & Beverage Manufacturing,Manufacturing,$25 to $50 million (USD),51 to 200 Employees,Company - Private

Industry PhD Scholarship: Generative Models in the Fourier Domain,Leonardo.Ai,null,['4.0'],"Generative Models in the Fourier Domain
Description
The Data Science Institute (DSI) at the University of Technology Sydney (UTS) is a world leader in data science and ethical artificial intelligence and has a strong focus on Industry engagement. The DSI boasts over 200 PhD students and 100 academic staff with award winning researchers in AI
In collaboration with Leonardo.Ai we are advertising an industry PhD program that will tackle research questions at the bleeding edge of GenAI research with an aim to drive forward both foundational research in the field through traditional publication outputs, as well as supercharging the Leonardo.Ai platform. Leonardo.Ai is a world leader in generative AI and is building one of the leading AI laboratories in foundational AI research. Leonardo.Ai has also recently been acquired by Canva and now hosts over 200 million users through the combined platforms. Both Leonardo.Ai and Canva have strong principles in: being a good human being foremost, maximizing impact, moving at speed and owning our goals and winning together.
Project Aims
The overarching aim of this PhD is to explore and leverage the frequency domain (and other under-explored representations of pixel space) in training generative AI models across modalities e.g. image, video etc. The aim is to mode-reverse the diffusion process by using an autoregressive transformer (or similar techniques) to iteratively predict the frequency coefficients (and phase values) of the frequencies of an image, from low to high. In model training and inference we do observe low frequency components being initiated in the early generation steps, indicating that the denoising / attention process favors a starting point of broad scale structure. Effectively the Fourier domain is an underexplored space in training generative models and we want to exploit these techniques to produce state-of-the-art capabilities.
PhD research students will have access to leading edge compute facilities (e.g. H100s), a team of world class research leaders across both UTS, Leonardo and Canva, cutting edge datasets to conduct research, and mentoring and guidance to complete a best-in-class PhD research program.
Eligibility
We are looking for the best of the best! You will be adequately qualified to enter the UTS PhD scheme with Undergraduate / Postgraduate Qualifications in e.g. Computer Science, Data Science, AI, Physics, Mathematics or equivalent.
Candidate Profile
A strong background in programming, mathematics, statistics, physics or signal processing.
Knowledge and interest in Diffusion, GANs, LLMs and generative AI in general as demonstrated by independent project work in GitHub.
Proficiency in modern deep learning frameworks such as Pytorch or Jax.
Ideally, we are looking for candidates with previous experience in top-tier Tech companies. We, however, welcome applications from underrepresented groups and diverse backgrounds.
Proficiency in English (both Verbal and Written).
Location
This PhD will be hosted at the University of Technology Sydney and the student will spend significant time at the Leonardo.Ai headquarters, which is located on the waterfront in North Sydney (20 mins train ride from UTS).
Full Domestic Scholarship: Open to Australian citizens who will receive a full scholarship of $37k per year stipend + $10k per year top-up for 3.5 years.
Full International Scholarship: Open to all international applicants with $37k per year stipend, $45k per year international fees and $30k per year top-up for 3.5 years.

Senior Product Manager,Mutinex,$146K,['5.0'],"Description

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.

Founded in Australia and with multiple recent fundraises (backed by EVP) we are growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.

We have a hybrid work environment and this role is to be Sydney based to allow for semi-regular in-person time with the team. A few days a week in the office in Sydney will be required for this role.

We value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.

The role

Working on our core product, GrowthOS, you'll be part of a cross functional team to build features and experiences that help our customers manage their marketing data and make better decisions with that data.

We're a growing startup with a small team, which means this is a very hands-on role and you’ll get to help establish processes and embed best practice into how we work. You'd want to be comfortable and enjoy coming into early stages companies and products and contributing to those things, and be self aware that you don't need those things given to you to succeed and enjoy what you're doing.

You’ll need to get to know our customers and their needs, create a solid product strategy and roadmap, work with Data Science, Engineering and Design to deliver that roadmap, then collaborate with Marketing Science and Account Management to unlock the business value for our customers.

What does the first 30-90 days look like?

You'll learn about our product and the sector we are in, to understand the fundamentals of MMM so you can best understand the problems you are trying to solve for our customers.

After that, you will start to scope features and refine product processes and roadmaps, while building relationships with the Engineering and Data teams, and Customer squads.

When quarterly planning time rolls around, you’ll collaborate with product leadership to set objectives, define metrics and build out the roadmap.

How success will be measured?

Having positive impacts on key product metrics and customer outcomes, contributions to refining or creating product processes and increasing our momentum to delivery.

What we are looking for

Must haves:

Senior Product Management experience in either SaaS, startups, PLGs or on data centric products/platforms. You could be a top-of-your-game Senior looking to step up or a Lead looking for a change.
The ability to (and enjoy doing) end- to-end product strategy and delivery – you’ll be on the tools and wearing a few hats.
Strong analytical ability – there's a lot of data here so being able to look in the right places, identify key insights and turn those insights into decisions and action is needed.
Proven success in the 0-1 stage of product development. We’re not optimising and building small features, we’re innovating and leading the market.
You will need to have exposure to technical or data-led products in the past. Bonus points if you have a solid understanding of statistics and probability theory

Nice to have:

Previous experience working with data-centric products. Data is a core of our product and company so it's ideal if you can understand our Data Scientists, Engineers, Marketing Scientists and customers.

About Mutinex
We might be an early stage startup but we already have strong product market fit, household name clients (Samsung, Mars, CUB and ING to name a few) and millions in revenue.

Being early stage means we're also still pretty scrappy and you wouldn't be coming into a well oiled machine, yet. But you would get a lot of opportunity to design, build and oil the machine until it's super oily.

We aren't aiming to be another Tech Unicorn because Unicorns aren't real. We are aiming (and confident of being) more like a real and really big animal that lives for a long time, like a Bowhead Whale.

Mutinex is a startup B2B SaaS platform that provides in-depth data analytics for marketers to better understand their ROI and make better decisions with future spend.

Founded in Australia, we've hit millions in ARR & have seed funding ($5 million in May 2023 & $9.5 million in October 2023 backed by EVP) that we'll use for growing our team to continue to improve our product, bring in new customers and enable them to make better and more informed decisions.

We have a hybrid work environment with teams in Sydney, Melbourne and expanding into the US.

With a team of around 60 people we value high quality communication, strong opinions that are held loosely and people who can give and take feedback well.

Equity (ESOP) is offered to all staff on top of their salary and we also offer additional annual leave after 1 year of tenure (from 20 to 25 days a year) that continues to grow another day each year of service until you max out at 30 days per year.","Skills: Power BI, Microsoft Excel, Data analysis skills, Tableau, SQL",Redfern,--,--,--,Unknown / Non-Applicable,1 to 50 Employees,Company - Private

We need your help to build, improve and maintain the infrastructure required to stream and enrich data from a variety of internal and external sources. Together, we will enhance our cloud-based data platform to get the right info, infer useful things and make better decisions. Then test, and keep improving. In areas where the data platform is already fully functional, you'll lend your sharp logic to improve internal processes, automate systems, and optimise, well, everything. And down the track, we'd love you to get involved with some Bayesian analysis, machine learning and other interesting data-related projects.
If you get excited by the idea of providing the right data to inform great decisions; and you want that data to be accessible, understandable and trustworthy, then this could be the job for you. If you bring your experience, smarts and detail-oriented brain to help us, we'll offer a world-class team to learn from, the tools you need to do your thing, and the support you need to flourish.

Built out a handful of new pipelines to bring more of our core business data into our data platform within our GCP and AWS environments
Chased a handful of data validation alerts raised by our pipelines, and taken the time to get to the root cause of each of them, then either delegated the fix to an appropriate someone else or fixed them yourself
Worked outside of data team, with our developers, flexing your database and query optimisation skills to decide whether to fix a performance issue they're having at the database level, or insist that the fix should be in the code (and, that's fun - they're an excellent bunch)
Provided an ad-hoc analysis (working with our analysts) to someone who requested it, integrating a one-off data source
Talked with our Data Manager about some of our mid-term plans, and how we'll support them with data
Re-engineered an existing data flow to handle an order-of-magnitude growth in the amount passing through the flow.

THESE ARE SOME QUALITIES YOU MUST POSSESS:
At least five years experience in a data engineering role
Advanced working knowledge of SQL and experience in ETL and streaming using a workflow management tool such as Apache NiFi (our chosen tool)
Experience with building and optimising data pipelines
Experience with collecting data from a variety of sources including APIs (good APIs, bad APIs, and ugly APIs)
Strong analytical skills and an ability to perform root cause analysis
Training in at least one of Computer Science, Statistics, Informatics, Information Systems or another relevant quantitative field (or demonstrable skill in one of those areas and the story of how you built that skill without formal training)
Very high precision – you need to know how to verify that your work is correct (even when dealing with unreliable data, where uncertainty may be inherent)
Bonus points for more relevant experience, such as with programming languages used in our projects (e.g., Ruby on Rails, Python, R, Haskell, TypeScript/JavaScript), PostgreSQL, AWS Aurora, Google BigQuery, Pub/Sub, project management and machine learning.

Consultant or Senior Consultant - Transaction Analytics - Strategy and Transactions,EY,null,['3.7'],"If we inspire you to do the work you love, will you still call it work?

At EY we believe that whoever you are, your uniqueness helps us stand apart.

We bring together extraordinary people, like you, to build a better working world.

Join Transaction Analytics and you join a unique and rapidly growing area, leveraging data to derive insights through a commercial lens and enhancing our clients’ decision making on M&A transactions.

We’re looking for Senior Consultants and Consultants to help grow our team to new heights!

What’s in it for you?

In Transaction Analytics we provide data-driven solutions aimed to enhance our clients’ decision making during financial due diligence. You’ll join an established and market leading team of forward-thinking analytics professionals in a project delivery capacity.

This role comes with exciting, challenging and demanding client projects. In our downtime, it also provides the chance to innovate in our capability to develop assets that efficiently generate strategic and commercially relevant insights.

Moreover, because we are at the frontier of M&A decision making and its intersection with analytics, there is an exciting opportunity to experience the continued growth of the team and our overall capability as you also continue to develop in your own career.

These questions will help give you a sense of whether working with this team will be a rewarding experience:

Are you a corporate finance professional who jumps at the chance to dive into data and uncover deeper insights into business performance and growth?
Are you a qualified (or almost qualified) accountant at a mid-to-top tier firm, having picked up some analytics along the way, and keen to break into the world of M&A?
Or maybe your background is as a data analyst, yet you feel more comfortable as the storyteller and have a proven ability to use data to support high impact decisions (corporate strategy, finance, marketing, investing, etc.)?
Do you see data analytics playing an important role in the future of your career – yet are more driven by the questions it helps to answer than the tech, and/or don’t see yourself as a pure technologist?

About you

We consider candidates from a range of different professional backgrounds, however successful candidates will typically identify confidently with at least two of the following three areas:

Commercial acumen and ability to see the big picture. You’ll have experience in the likes of strategy, management consulting, corporate finance or accounting, and are comfortable contributing through these lenses when explaining the results of your analyses.
Quantitative / analytics skills and numerical reasoning. You are adept at both manipulating and interpreting large datasets, your eye for detail will mean you’ve reconciled your results and isolated any material anomalies, and you can translate business to technical and vice versa.
Consulting skills and predisposition towards agility. You are curious and articulate with clever questions and the ability to build rapport, you are comfortable with navigating through ambiguity and unfamiliar problems, and you take a proactive approach to planning your work and team communication.

While we’re looking for both Senior Consultant and Consultant level candidates, the above descriptions align more closely to our expectations at a Senior Consultant level.

A Senior Consultant level candidate will typically have at least 3 years of experience and are expected to coach juniors through solving problems more independently and improving on quality.

A Consultant level candidate will typically have up to 3 years of experience and can be confidently identified as being on the growth path to our Senior Consultant level expectations.

The technologies we use day-in and day-out include Alteryx, Power BI (including advanced DAX), Power Query and Power Pivot. We occasionally dabble with the likes of Python, R and SQL, which tend to be more on the basis of innovation or new types of projects.

Don’t feel like you need to be fully proficient in these technologies when you join us, as we provide both formal and on the job training. We’ll just be looking for evidence that you have what it takes to pick up the tech and hack it out in the long run.

Finally, to give you an idea of the cohort that you would be growing and progressing into in the future, here are some additional things set people apart from day one at a Manager level and beyond:

Experience in an M&A transaction environment, strategy or management consulting
Further post-graduate studies (completed or in progress) in a commercially oriented discipline (e.g. CA, CPA, CFA, MBA, etc.)
Demonstrable experience in having developed strong commercial awareness to analyse business context and performance and understand key business drivers
An entrepreneurial track record, to identify client needs and devise commercial propositions in the absence of precedent or guidance
A sensitivity for and motivation towards bringing the best out of team-mates at all levels
Strong team leadership and project management skills
A team-level-success-driven mindset
